## Functionality of the Video Creator

The video creator uses my API [JokeAPI](github.com/HussBTW/YT/JokeAPI) to create something that resembles a TikTok video, given 3 jokes in the video.

**NOTE: THERE IS SITLL A HUGE VARIETY OF PROBLEMS WITH THIS, AS IN A HIGH BETA VERSION.**

## How To Use

Firstly, clone the repository by the following command: 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/HussBTWYT/JokeAPI-Video-Creator
```

Secondly, Install the Python requirements using `pip install -r requirements.txt`, and to access this enter the command to enter the repository:

```bash
cd JokeAPI-Video-Creator
```

After that, go inside the **Python Video Creator** using the following:

```bash
cd Python Video Creator
```

Once doing all of these, open **main.py** and change the following lines to your own paths:

```bash
background_video_path = r"your/path/to/minecraft_background.mp4"
```




```bash
output_video_directory = r"your/path/to/Outputted Videos"
```


*Make sure to save your main.py file!*

Then, open command prompt and write the following command:

```bash
python main.py
```

Then, check the directory of **"Outputted Videos"** and you should see your video.

*Note that outputted videos file's name go in order, e.g. output_video.mp4, then output_video1.mp4, then output_video2.mp4 (if output_video.mp4 already exists, this order occurs)*
